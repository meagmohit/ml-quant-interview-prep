1. How LSTMs solve vanishing gradient problem? Be specific, how in terms of gates?
2. What is the problem with constant initialization (e.g., 0-initialization or 1-initialization) of weights in NNs
3. How to evaluate the model for time-series data (e.g., predicting developing heart disease in next 3 months?)
